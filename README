Hello,

Thank you for considering me.

Few things to note:
* I implemented ActiveTweet similar to ActiveRecord, specially when it comes to chaining
* I implemented 4 scenarios in cucumber
* I implemented 2 simple test cases in rspec

Steps to running the tests:
* Clone this git repo
* Run "bundle install"
* Run the cucumber steps using "bundle exec cucumber features"
* Run the specs using "bundle exec rspec spec"

Thank you,
Sarkis Karayan
